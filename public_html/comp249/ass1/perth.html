  Perth is a sprawling metropolis lying on the banks of the Swan River
   and stretching along over 150km of the Indian Ocean.
<p> Perth is situated in the south-west corner of Western Australia and is
   the second most isolated city on the planet after Honolulu, Hawaii. In
   fact, Perth is closer to Singapore than Sydney!
<p>The isolation makes
   Perth seem like it is in a different country to the rest of Australia,
   providing a totally unique experience to anywhere else in the world -
   something Western Australians embrace with pride.
<p>Perth is a modern and sophistocated city with heaps of nightlife and
   wonderful beaches. Most noticable is the relaxed and friendly
   atmosphere which greets visitors.
