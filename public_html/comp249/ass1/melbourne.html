2. Go shopping at the Queen Victoria Markets!</b><br>
The Queen Victoria Market is more than just Melbourne’s shopping Mecca. This 19th century market is a historic landmark, a tourist attraction and an institution for all Melburnians.<br>
Fresh is the flavour of the market. More than fresh seafood and fresh fruits and vegetables, the market takes a fresh approach. Find clothing, baggage, toys, jewellery, new-age products and souvenirs at sinful prices.<br>
The complex of enclosed food halls, open sheds, shops and stores illustrate the variety of Melbourne culture through its produce whilst maintaining a vibrant sense of how a 19th century market functioned.<br>
