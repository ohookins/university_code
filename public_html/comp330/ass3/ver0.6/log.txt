Thursday May 17th
	15:00-16:00
	- Adapting blobbyman code to a simple scene
	without animation.

	16:00-17:00
	- Implementing lighting and perspective effects

	17:00-18:00
	- Downloading and examining RGBpixmap code.
	- RGBpixmap found to be crap.

	18:00-19:00
	- started typing RGBpixmap from book.
	- debugging RGBpixmap and adding filler code

	19:00-20:00
	- integrating RGBpixmap with main code and testing
	pixmap displaying.
	- Textures over 256x256 don't appear to work
	- Posted message on Programming board.

	20:00-22:00
	- Found that textures have to be of side length
	2^n. Posted solution on Programming board.
	- Adding surfaces and generating textures:
	Now have floor,ceiling,4 walls, 3 spheres on
	3 axes, and blobby man
	
	22:00-23:00
	- Problem with texture mapping, where the 3d
	objects are no longer rendered properly.
	Not sure why this is happening, perhaps due to
	running under Cygwin or Win2000

Friday May 18th
	11:00-15:00
	- Trying in vain to get Mesa and glut working under
	my installation of Redhat 7.0.9 beta.

	15:00-16:00
	- Reinstalling Redhat 7.0
	- Downloaded latest 2.4.4 kernel and compiled

	16:00-17:00
	- Copied assignment over from Win2000 partition
	and compiled.
	- Same rendering issues found as under Cygwin

	17:00-18:00
	- Searched on google for glTexEnvf syntax, after
	finding that removing that command fixes the
	rendering problem.
	- Found that to render 3d objects proprly, it
	is necessary to disable 2d textures after they
	are drawn.
	- Posted solution on Programming board.

	18:00-21:00
	- Adding in a sofa with different coloured fabrics
	to simulate realistic shadows - easier than gl shadows.

Monday May 21st
	19:00-20:00
	- Adding in the ability to view the room from each
	corner.

	20:00-21:00
	- Fixing some pretty major bugs in the code, due to
	throwing the whole lot together haphazardly.

	21:00-22:00
	- After fixing code, the test spheres on the axes
	started producing some strange visual artifacts,
	mostly 'speckles' etc.
	- Posted message to Programming forum, searched
	the net for potential solutions.

	22:00-23:00
	- After much hair pulling and commenting out of
	bits of code, I gave up and recompiled under
	linux/Mesa. Guess what? It's fine.
	Damn windows.

	23:00-0:00
	- ...except now compiling under linux, all of the
	perspective effects are gone. Arrrggghghh!!!

Tueday May 22nd
	11:00-14:00
	- Trying various things to fix strange problems,
	nothing seems to work.
	- Resolved to get assistance and scheduled a
	meeting with Matt Roberts.

	21:00-0:00
	- More stuffing around trying to get it to work
	unsuccessfully.

Wednesday May 23rd
	10:00-11:00
	- Playing with some parameters but essentially
	nothing is different - same lack of perspective
	under Mesa.

	19:00-20:00
	- Changed some lighting effects based on
	information given in lecture. Light sources
	are now being placed properly and are working.
	- Fixed some surfaces that were being drawn
	back-to-front.

	21:00-22:00
	- Recompiled under cygwin and played with the
	lighting effects.
	- Discovered by accident that the glDepthTest
	function is causing the 'speckled' effect on the
	objects. GL_ALWAYS seems to be unaffected, but
	this causes objects to be displayed in front of
	each other.
