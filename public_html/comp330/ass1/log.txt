Wednesday, March 28 11:30-12:00
	- Reading textbook on canvas class
	- Typing in Point2 and IntRect classes

Friday, March 30 10:15-11:00
	- Typing in Canvas.h declaration, starting nodemaster.cc
	- Became utterly confused and worried, need to entirely
	rethink approach, or rather, actually think through approach
	for the first time.

Sunday, April 1 20:00-23:30
	- Totally re-planned entire project on paper
	- Downloaded the Red Book, STL "list.h" documentation
	- Read GNU make documentation
	- Designed and wrote Node.cc
	- Wrote new improved multi-platform makefile

Monday, April 2 10:00-12:00
	- Compiling is generating errors - GL/glut.h not found
	- Posted message to message board
	- Fiddled with settings in Cygwin and Pompeii till I realised there was
	an $(INCLUDE) missing from one of the lines

	14:00-20:00
	- Fixed up remaining small compilation problems
	- Read section in Red Book on menus and tried to understand it
	- Got Submenus and submenu items working properly.
	- Set up Shape and Colour picking for new items.
	- Set up different action modes, and menus for them.

	11:00-11:30
	- Typed body of Canvas.cc, and fleshed it out.

Tuesday, April 3 12:00-15:00
	- Fixed small compiling and syntax errors in Point2, RealRect,
	IntRect, Canvas
	- Integrated Canvas & helper classes into Nodemaster.

	22:00-11:30
	- Implemented filledTri, filledSqr, filledCir
	- Made some rudimentary code to take care of user resizing the window
	- Noticed that display of menus require redrawing of screen contents.

Wednesday, April 4 11:30-12:00
	- Recompiled on Pompeii (all previous work on Cygwin)
	& realised that the menu damage to the screen does not occur under X
	... very strange...
	- Drawing nodes to screen & placing in list is all fine.
	- Started on a redraw function.

	3:30-4:00
	- Puzzling over how to maintain node sizes. Ended up keeping track
	of aspect and window to viewport ratios, and multiplying the
	appropriate numbers. Not quite successful.

	5:30-7:00
	- Decided to reset the window and viewport values to the new
	physical window sizes to fix node size changing. It worked!
	- Not sure how to read node data once in the list. Searched for
	some easy to read docs on bi-directional iterators.
	- Figured out how to create and use the iterator, making use of
	webpages and the discussion groups to find out.
	- Implemented the redraw function.

	9:00-12:00
	- Realised that method for solving shrinking/expanding nodes etc
	is completely by accident, and in fixing it, completely break the
	operation of that function.
	- Fix the resizing issue, but in doing so, make the entire drawing
	now relative to the origin, located at bottom left.
	- Fixed redraw function, respawning old nodes - huge memory leak.
	- Fixed colour and shape not updating after redraw.
	- Tried to figure out a method for drawing arrowed lines, but failed.
